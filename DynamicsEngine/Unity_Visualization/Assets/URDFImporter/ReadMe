---------------------------------------------------- URDF Importer -----------------------------------------------------
========================================================================================================================
This is a clean and simple editor extension for Unity3D which lets you import robot models that are specified as URDF 
(Unified Robot Description Format) files. The importer loads the visual geometry including meshes and materials of the 
robots, so you can use them for your work or games in Unity3D. All you need to provide is a .urdf file (not .xacro), 
the meshes in .dae, .obj or .fbx format, and the materials if they are not contained in the mesh files. The full 
hierarchical kinematic structure with single game objects for each joint and link is loaded. The importer is platform-
independent, and works on Windows, Linux and Mac.

If you are interested in an inverse kinematics (IK) solver which works on all these robots and with multiple goals, 
check out the Bio IK asset. In addition, the importer will then also automatically add the joints of Bio IK to create 
the motion of the segments, as shown in the available videos.

=== Usage ===
#1 Navigate to the navigation bar of Unity, and go to "Addons/URDF Importer"
#2 Enter or search the path to your .urdf file, which must be stored within the Assets/ database of Unity3D along with the meshes and materials
#3 Set the Mesh Export Orientation (Usually Y or Z worked for all my cases, otherwise use 'Custom' and set the correct orientation)
#4 Hit "Import Model"

=== Requirements ===
Make sure that all meshes are available as importable formats by Unity3D, e.g. .fbx / .dae / .obj. Then, simply specify 
all paths of the meshes and materials inside the .urdf file relative to it, so the importer can find them.

=== Demo ===
In case you encounter some problems, you might want to check out the demo with the Nao robot. This can be done by opening the importer
and searching for the Assets/Demo/nao.urdf file.

If you have any questions or would like me to test a particular robot in advance, just let me know.
