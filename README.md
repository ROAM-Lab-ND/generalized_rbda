# Generalized Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms

## Summary
This repository contains a C++ library of rigid-body dynamics algorithms that are **compatible with kinematic loops** and especially efficient for those induced by common **actuation sub-mechanisms** like geared transmissions, differential drives, and closed-chain linkages.  
The algorithms are based on the principle of **constraint embedding**, originally developed by Jain [1](https://watermark.silverchair.com/139_1.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAABPYwggTyBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggTjMIIE3wIBADCCBNgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMVpAz0QBG_TLnW6dtAgEQgIIEqcYTCuhh4cgP4Ki2supwv4C5NUDfGljTL8R22IlekhuRRYjOg8TTnUUPM1Uz_g6SC-PbIus0bXqaSjuwsYiTbNTyGAF8BKWh2M2E8XrB5ElCYsRLVLoX4cM9BZN0faog65pCiPr_7kkRyaq8oxFu_T0l0t-3FzlinLwk9GGttXg1Nw6zxAc5t3AYxRw3yl86XDt83foeEWCtcO7-LOBqIiX6EpVZcPm--Ajbys3TZSTC5fA81-H9VBn5Sp2ZZgRZdXvfAF9R0zRcuZ5L-037imoFQVLNMEyner8r5KKJjuEQzinT63seEdvyK9lKaX2BHz7QeXqJm4QB7tapDXgy-jdrWgWBkH8JlRJOzWWzm1fGRFCi3jvAzFRePYNTMCJqxB9rJJhMchJK2vIqeDNhZxQmPmtb0Wq1wY7exRene4Lbmnde9E645BTsntrmjEoolg4idKBReOR3UgVR_bOeJ-7AJ8VnltYNW8UkXrl7HSOxN5Hd-_VESQLnVXfI5H2nTC0SBb17mmCvaoZjmz29VXdfArnSdwI9KQZRPuXBjiubqbPI8p5CxmvMQxIbYzusIHf6E34LFKWs-WSkO61KOfuFwByR4DJJLBTJrXYJz4u5G4Deccbokup4XMKumrA0QVnteOwC1sUuHNbbGqew6uf_xL-XlgctHjS3r0-5moSy_hYcsyeIBE7pT7tSuIYvuovjHIPeIlHPBNcvA4odVfEYWUWUdqsPFWjdIykEb439w6A4vIhDrVWJqhTucGp70PT0sXXw3d3A9JmjqQXd8UDBpM6nDCNHkDvmQyWXSpoiki-nopKXJVrhcuPuGW0JNZZm8w39N57pOBpPBgyOC2NjBBOwZBDXY1FmlSxnDWBRxkPt3sG_Q3qSAjUwiico8lPn0QJtUulVGceXteP6rjkqZHjNaPM5jNdSWNQ6VDHV_8MrxlCiEOKho5H4mPN6BRINP66eCQlvXRhEKDPhhMI8R1PzhGH8DotSg065JECCAn41WsJwLquJ1jQLToDnLJhx3MIoY8_26CZ36oMgSyzgX9OYrl9qBsmuKFimvp9oiTLIJ19wh6T_DwH6ipavqrSB1fOQ7TaYlWfPffe_9z2Ur9IdD5XIM5mVRh9GAdx6wtWD-iGFrloa1RpnLa_cpnVQLpr7OoH2pr7Kaip_5RfRanx3zVALJAwJDTQCMh4zGmrEotdo8X2xUhHIxUSKyKOOPVwe1s_3kS2hTjenm4WOoZtqCX7AKQNRlsWOdoc3uAiOiiBs_ZrcQIHDik_Vd80QApphnQl7NZ97oaMJ31zmo_ztiJBZYL9BpwT1wIBqs5auKMscIJDdHHr4qihegBujtrsWCMRB7UwF2DZkPW10jnHmaudboN-LynhlM1mGKjaCG6-m9Uk4mOdo0lStOGloVm9zfXnZDtdm6J38Qdf0HuQ0_ghK_liZOMNsz4TnejxOAUJlzN3Q9CjE7Pz7BrM5j-XOwJkzeDw13OiCTjSIqodSc55Q12CyFvmOGWv3gxpMBVEB-qcHVXY_k4gONd5MD0F4mnA0uIhElvaWpC3LEPuwAwL0HFmkOfxHKMuB9cD6WINcNbbP), and revisited through our propagation-based perspective.
Details of this propagation perspective are presented in our [accompanying paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13732).
Our software reflects this **complementary formulation** that generalizes the traditional concept of joint models and motion/force subspaces—extending them from single rigid bodies to **groups of bodies** linked through local loops.

__Note__: For notational continuity with the literature, our paper refers to these groups of bodies as "aggregate links" and the constraints between them as "aggregate joints". However, in this repository, we refer to them as "clusters" and "cluster joints" respectively.

Actuation sub-mechanisms are increasingly common in robotic systems, yet no open-source library existed to compute their dynamics efficiently.  
The loops these mechanisms induce violate assumptions of conventional recursive dynamics algorithms.  
**Constraint embedding** resolves this by **grouping bodies into clusters**, allowing the loop constraints to be resolved **locally** during forward/backward passes.  
This repository provides the first open-source implementation of these ideas in a modern, templated C++ library.

## Usage

As a general purpose rigid-body dynamics library, the project can be used in a variety of ways.
The most common uses are as follows:
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Using the constrained forward dynamics algorithms and the contact dynamics algorithms, the repository can be used as part of a simulator for contact-rich robotic systems.
- **Model-Based Control**: Using the inverse dynamics algorithms, the repository can be used to as part of a whole-body controller to compute the control torques required to achieve a desired state.

We offer multiple ways to construct a model, including:
- **Manual Model Construction**: The user can manually construct a model by following these steps:
   - Register all of the bodies contained in a cluster by providing their connectivity and inertia information.
   - Append those bodies to the model by providing information about the cluster joint that connects them.
   - Repeat the above steps for each cluster in the system.

   User can leverage the provided specialized classes for common cluster joint types. Specific examples of how to build a model can be found in the [README](include/grbda/Dynamics/README.md) detailing the process.
- **URDF Parsing**: For robots without kinematics loops, the user can parse a standard URDF file to automatically construct the model. For systems with loops, we support the [URDF+](https://github.com/mit-biomimetics/urdfdom) format—a minimal extension of URDF to specify kinematic loops. URDF+ preserves compatibility with existing tooling while enabling loop specification directly in XML. We refer readers to the [URDF+ format paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769903) for full details.

## Configuration

if(GRBDA_LIBRARY)
    set(GRBDA_LIBRARIES ${GRBDA_LIBRARIES} ${GRBDA_LIBRARY})
